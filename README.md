# Proposal fork for support of Chipsailing CS9711Fingprint

This fork of [libfprint](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint) is a proposal for the [Chipsailing CS9711](http://www.chipsailing.com/ProductsStd_250.html) fingerprint reader, tracked in this [issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/-/issues/610). This reader is commonly in accessible USB dongles as `2541:0236`, and also the one included in the GPD Win Max 2 2023 as `2541:9711`.

Note that enrollment count is 15 touches, so insist a bit.

Note also that this is based on an experimental image recognition from the [`sigfm`](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint/-/merge_requests/418) proposal.

**No garantees are made by this author as to the validity and security of this code,
while this author is very happy with the result, it should not be used for anything
serious without serious testing.**

## History

**LibFPrint** was originally developed as part of an
academic project at the **[University Of Manchester]**.

It aimed to hide the differences between consumer
fingerprint scanners and provide a single uniform
API to application developers.

## Goal

The ultimate goal of the **FPrint** project is to make
fingerprint scanners widely and easily usable under
common Linux environments.

## License

`Section 6` of the license states that for compiled works that use
this library, such works must include **LibFPrint** copyright notices
alongside the copyright notices for the other parts of the work.

**LibFPrint** includes code from **NIST's** **[NBIS]** software distribution.

We include **Bozorth3** from the **[US Export Controlled]**
distribution, which we have determined to be fine
being shipped in an open source project.
